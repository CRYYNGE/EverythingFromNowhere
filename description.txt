Howdy, and welcome back to the Everything from Nowhere mod!

This mod aims to change large aspects of the Terraria game, including new content, mechanics, and an entire new class!

LATEST UPDATE:

* Added a new Material, Steel, which can be used to craft a new set of weapons!
* Added Charcoal, which can be used to craft Steel, along with other items!
* Removed previous stuff, and redoing the mod from scratch, to make it more balanced and fun!

LATEST PATCH:

* Added the Sewing Machine, which will be used soon! It can also be used to replace the Loom.
